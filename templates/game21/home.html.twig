    <h2>
        How to Play 21 (Blackjack)
    </h2>
    <p>
        21, also known as Blackjack, is a popular card game where the goal is to
        get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Card Values
    </h2>
    <p>
        Number cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value. Face cards (Jack,
        Queen, King) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be 1 or 11 points,
        whichever is better for the player.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Game Setup
    </h2>
    <p>
        1. Gather a standard deck of 52 playing cards.<br />
        2. Assign a dealer who will deal the cards.<br />
        3. The dealer represents the house, and other players play against the dealer.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Gameplay
    </h2>
    <p>
        1. The dealer gives each player (including themselves) two face-up
        cards.<br />
        2. The dealer's first card is face-up, and the second card is face-down.<br />
        3. Players take turns before the dealer's final turn.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Player's Turn
    </h2>
    <p>
        During their turn, a player can:<br />
        1. <strong>Hit:</strong> Get another card from the dealer to increase their
        hand total.<br />
        2. <strong>Stand:</strong> Decline more cards and keep the current hand total.<br />
        3. <strong>Double Down:</strong> Double their bet and receive one more card,
        then they must stand.<br />
        4. <strong>Split:</strong> If the first two cards have the same rank, they
        can split them into two separate hands.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Dealer's Turn
    </h2>
    <p>
        After all players finish their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down
        card and follows the house rules. Usually, the dealer must hit until
        they have 17 or higher, then stand.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Winning and Losing
    </h2>
    <p>
        - If a player's hand total exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose their bet.<br />
        - If the dealer busts, all remaining players win their bets.<br />
        - If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand (without busting),
        they win and receive a payout equal to their bet.<br />
        - If the player and dealer have the same total, it's a "push," and the player
        keeps their bet without additional winnings.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Blackjack
    </h2>
    <p>
        A "Blackjack" is an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, or King)
        in the initial two cards. It's the highest hand and often pays out at
        3:2.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Basic Strategy
    </h2>
    <p>
        - Hit if your hand total is 11 or lower.<br />
        - Stand if your hand total is 17 or higher.<br />
        - If the dealer's face-up card is 7 or higher, continue hitting until your
        hand total is 17 or higher.<br />
        - With a soft hand (Ace in hand), you can be more aggressive in hitting without
        busting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remember, Blackjack is a game of chance and strategy. Have fun and good
        luck!
