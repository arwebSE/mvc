                Hi, my name is August and I'm a junior developer based in
                Stockholm, Sweden. I am currently finishing up my studies and
                developing applications using various technologies such as
                Symfony, React, and Node. I'm also passionate about creating &
                playing music. I also like flying drones and ride my motorcycle
                in my freetime aswell. I do love software though, and enjoy
                tinkering with small programming projects in my freetime.
            </p>
